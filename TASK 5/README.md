## Python

To start with Python you can use this website/book. To learn the basics of Python, you can learn up to chapter 11 (up to chapter 8 is also enough) or you can learn from Youtube too. But make sure you answer all the questions from these exercises at the end of the chapter in a text file for each chapter and add them to a folder, and upload them to GitHub.
